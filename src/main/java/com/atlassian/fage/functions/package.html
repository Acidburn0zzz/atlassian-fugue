        These classes provide convenience methods to use with Google's Guava (the new name for their Collections
        library), with a focus on augmenting Guava's Supplier and Function.
        
        Tasks which usually work but occasionally fail can be retried using {@link RetryFunction} and
        {@link RetrySupplier}. The recommended way of obtaining instances of these classes is through
        {@link RetryFactory.create}. The behaviour when an attempt at a task fails can be controlled by an
        {@link ExceptionHandler}, which can be obtained and chained together via {@link ExceptionHandlers}. The
        following code wraps the getUserCount() method in a Supplier whose get() method attempts to get the user count 3
        times, each separated by 200 milliseconds. It returns as soon a user count is successfully retrieved.
        
        <pre>
            Supplier&lt;Integer&gt; userCountSupplier = new Supplier&lt;Integer&gt;() {
                public Integer get() {
                    // Occasionally fails (for example, due to cache invalidation) but does not normally repeatedly fail.
                    return getUserCount();
                }
            };
            Supplier&lt;Integer&gt; retryUserCountSupplier = 
                RetryFactory.create(userCountSupplier, 3, ExceptionHandlers.delayingExceptionHandler(200));
            
            Integer userCount = retryUserCountSupplier.get(); 
        </pre>
