        These classes provide convenience methods to use with Google's Guava (the new name for their Collections
        library), with a focus on augmenting Guava's Supplier and Function.

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p>
        Currently, the two main features of this library are <a href="#retry">Retry</a> and <a href="#fold">Fold</a>. 
        </p>
        
        <a name="retry"/>
        <h3>Retry</h3>
        <p>
        Tasks which usually work but occasionally fail can be retried using
        {@link com.atlassian.fage.functions.RetryFunction} and {@link com.atlassian.fage.functions.RetrySupplier}. The
        recommended way of obtaining instances of these classes is through
        {@link com.atlassian.fage.functions.RetryFactory}'s create method. The behaviour when an attempt at a task fails
        can be controlled by an {@link com.atlassian.fage.functions.ExceptionHandler}, which can be obtained and chained
        via {@link com.atlassian.fage.functions.ExceptionHandlers}. The following code wraps the getUserCount() method
        in a Supplier whose get() method attempts to get the user count 3 times, each separated by 200 milliseconds. It
        returns as soon a user count is successfully retrieved.
        
        <code>
            <pre>
            Supplier&lt;Integer&gt; userCountSupplier = new Supplier&lt;Integer&gt;() {
                public Integer get() {
                    // Occasionally fails (for example, due to cache invalidation) but does not normally repeatedly fail.
                    return getUserCount();
                }
            };
            Supplier&lt;Integer&gt; retryUserCountSupplier = 
                RetryFactory.create(userCountSupplier, 3, ExceptionHandlers.delayingExceptionHandler(200));
            
            Integer userCount = retryUserCountSupplier.get(); 
            </pre>
        </code>
        </p>
        
        <a name="fold"/>
        <h3>Fold</h3>
        <p>A variety of fold operations are also supported. Left and right folds can be accessed through the
        {@link com.atlassian.fage.functions.Fold} class, which also supports obtaining uncurried left and right folders
        using the <code>with</code> and <code>withRight</code> methods. Finally, it also supports uncurrying Guava
        Functions to be used in the other methods provided; the uncurry method requires a function to be applied to the
        first parameter and a function which generates other functions to be applied to the second parameter. These
        generated functions are pulled from the apply() method of the generator, which should construct them using the
        result of the other function (which passed as the apply method to the generator) so the constructed function's
        apply method can use it.
        </p>
        <h2>Beta methods and classes</h2>
        <p>
        Some classes and methods are marked @Beta. These should be viewed as liable to change or be removed across point
        releases.
