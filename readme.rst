Functional Extensions to Guava
------------------------------

Google's guava project is a solid utility library providing many useful interfaces
and utilities, and it is a very commonly added dependency for most projects.
Unfortunately, they have a strong NIH syndrome and are somewhat half-pregnant
when it comes to functional-programming. This library attempts round out some of 
the deficiencies that a functional programmer finds when using Guava.

In particular it provides Option and Either types similar to the Scala library
as well as a Pair.

There also additional helper classes for common Function and Supplier operations.
