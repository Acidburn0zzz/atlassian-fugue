        These classes provide convenience methods to use with Google's Guava (the new name for their Collections
        library), with a focus on augmenting Guava's Supplier and Function. For completeness' sake, support for
        Java's Runnable is also provided.

        <h3>Retry</h3>
        <p>
        Tasks which usually work but occasionally fail can be retried using
        {@link com.atlassian.fugue.functions.RetryFunction}, {@link com.atlassian.fugue.functions.RetrySupplier}, and
        {@link com.atlassian.fugue.functions.RetryTask}. The simplest way of obtaining instances of these classes is
        through {@link com.atlassian.fugue.functions.RetryFactory}'s create method, but they can also be constructed
        directly. The behaviour when an attempt at a task fails can be controlled by an
        {@link com.atlassian.fugue.functions.ExceptionHandler}, which can be obtained and chained via
        {@link com.atlassian.fugue.functions.ExceptionHandlers}. The following code wraps the getUserCount() method
        in a Supplier whose get() method attempts to get the user count 3 times, each separated by 200 milliseconds.
        It returns as soon as a user count is successfully retrieved.
        
        <code>
            <pre>
            Supplier&lt;Integer&gt; userCountSupplier = new Supplier&lt;Integer&gt;() {
                public Integer get() {
                    // Occasionally fails (for example, due to cache invalidation) but does not normally repeatedly fail.
                    return getUserCount();
                }
            };
            Supplier&lt;Integer&gt; retryUserCountSupplier = 
                RetryFactory.create(userCountSupplier, 3, ExceptionHandlers.delayingExceptionHandler(200));
            
            Integer userCount = retryUserCountSupplier.get(); 
            </pre>
        </code>
